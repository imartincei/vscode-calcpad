' Test syntax highlighting for escaped quotes

x = 5

' Double quoted strings with escapes:
msg1 = "This is a simple string"
msg2 = "This contains an escaped quote: ""Hello"" world"
msg3 = "Multiple ""escaped"" ""quotes"" in one string"

' Single quoted strings with escapes:
msg4 = 'Simple single quote string'
msg5 = 'This has an escaped quote: ''Hello'' world'
msg6 = 'Multiple ''escaped'' ''quotes'' here'

' Mixed examples:
result = x + "String with ""escaped"" quote" + 10

' Edge cases:
empty = ""
emptyEscape = """"
singleChar = "a"
justEscape = "''"
